# Video Surveillance over IP

A full-featured, browser-based video surveillance system that captures webcam input using FFmpeg and streams it in real time using MPEG-DASH. The backend is built with Node.js and Express, which launches FFmpeg automatically to stream live DASH segments. The frontend includes a **self-built video player** using HTML5 and JavaScript (without relying on native browser controls), powered by [dash.js](https://github.com/Dash-Industry-Forum/dash.js) for MPEG-DASH playback.

This project is a course project. The full project description and requirements can be found in the [Video Surveillance over IP.pdf](./Video%20Surveillance%20over%20IP.pdf) file included in this repository.
